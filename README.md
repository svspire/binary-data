# binary-data
This is a fork of code from Chapter 24 of Peter Siebel's book Practical Common Lisp. http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/practical-parsing-binary-files.html. I've moved dependencies all here to this one directory and made a custom asd file because I don't want to have to load all the code from Siebel's book. I've also renamed Siebel's package names to something shorter.
